#### Data processing pipeline for ephys and 3D tracking experiments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository should facilitate the data processing pipeline for ephys, IMU and 3D tracking experiments.

It is useful for:
1. concatenating multiple Neuropixel recording sessions
2. running kilosort through Python
3. splitting clusters back to original sessions / getting spike times
4. reading sync events from the Neuropixel recording files
5. assessing whether the recording, tracking and IMU systems are synced
6. converting raw tracking files to a format loadable by the lab GUI

Please refer to the executor notebook for further instructions.
